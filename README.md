If There Are People Who Want To Work With Me. I will ask people who want to work with me about something. 
If that person wants to work with me, he won't be paid because this framework is made for the public, which means free.

This is a framework made by jonathanmart and thekotekjournal you make it for the public free of charge. For documentation, 
we will improve it and the many uses of this framework, the php file is a little so you can see to see what you don't know 
in the app / core, you can search to find out what you need to know, actually there is still a lot you can know such as fire, 
security, utf8. That way you can hold the experts of this framework well and become a master of this framework, security and 
utf8 are taken from codeignither3. and thank you for using this framework. php can be from 5> 7. The error will run if you
